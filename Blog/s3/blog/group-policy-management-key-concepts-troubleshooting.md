## Group Policy Management: Key Concepts and Troubleshooting

When managing a network in an Active Directory (AD) environment, **Group Policy** is an essential tool that allows administrators to control configurations and enforce security settings across multiple computers and users. Whether you're deploying software, setting up shared resources, or configuring security policies, Group Policy provides centralized control, making your job as an IT professional more efficient. Below is a walkthrough of common tasks, along with practical solutions for typical Group Policy-related tickets.

### 1. **Setting Up Group Policy Management Tools**

If you're in a helpdesk position and have **Domain Admin** permissions but don't have the necessary tools installed to work with Group Policy and Active Directory:

1. **Install Active Directory and Group Policy Management Tools**:
   - Go to **Apps and Features** > **Optional Features**.
   - Find and install **AD Users and Computers** and **Group Policy Management Tool**.

Once installed, you can start managing Group Policies and Active Directory using these tools.

### 2. **Creating and Managing Group Policies**

**Creating an Organizational Unit (OU)**:

- Open **AD Users and Computers Tool**.
- Right-click on your domain > **New** > **Organizational Unit** (OU).

**Creating a Group Policy for an OU**:

- Open **Group Policy Management Tool**.
- Right-click the OU you want to apply the policy to and choose **Create and Link GPO**.
- Name the policy accordingly.

**Editing a Group Policy**:

- Right-click on the Group Policy > **Edit** > **Computer Configuration** > **Software Settings** > **New** > **Package**.
- Use a shared network path (e.g., `\\domain_name\foldername`) to assign software packages.

**Applying the Group Policy to Computers**:

- After creating the GPO, navigate to **Security Filtering** in the Group Policy Management Tool and add the relevant computers to apply the policy.
- Run the command `gpupdate /force` on the target computers to update the Group Policy.

**Important**: Some policies, like software installations, require a system restart.

### 3. **Installing Software Using Group Policy**

- Download the software and place it in a **shared folder** using a network path like `\\domain_name\foldername`.
- In **Group Policy Management**, edit the policy for the relevant OU and go to **Computer Configuration** > **Software Installation**.
- Right-click > **New** > **Package** and select the `.msi` file from the network share.

### 4. **Printer Deployment Using Group Policy**

To deploy printers via Group Policy:

1. Go to **Server Manager** > **Manage** > **Add Roles and Features**.
2. Select **Print and Document Services** and install the print server role.
3. After installing the printer, go to **Print Management** in Server Manager, right-click the printer, and select **Deploy with Group Policy**.
4. Browse to the correct GPO and apply the policy to both computers and users.

Users can then find the printer under **Printers & Scanners** after running `gpupdate /force`.

If you don’t know about creating shared folder. Here's a detailed guide on **Creating a Shared Folder** to use in group policy.

### **Creating a Shared Folder**

This step allows you to share a folder across the network and give specific permissions to domain users.

### **Steps:**

1. **Create a Folder**:
   - Right-click anywhere on your desktop or in File Explorer, choose **New** > **Folder**. Name the folder as needed.
2. **Right-click the Folder and Select Properties**:
   - After creating the folder, right-click it and select **Properties** from the context menu.
3. **Go to the Sharing Tab**:
   - In the properties window, click on the **Sharing** tab.
   - Click on **Advanced Sharing**.
4. **Check "Share This Folder"**:
   - In the **Advanced Sharing** window, check the box that says **Share this folder**.
5. **Set Permissions**:
   - Click on the **Permissions** button.
   - In the **Permissions for [Folder Name]** window, click on **Add**.
6. **Add Domain Users**:
   - In the **Select Users or Groups** window, type `Domain Users` in the text box and click **Check Names**.
   - Click **OK** to add the Domain Users group.
7. **Give Full Access**:
   - After adding Domain Users, in the **Permissions** section, check the box for **Full Control**. ( give access as if mentioned in the document)
   - Click **Apply** and **OK**.
8. **Confirm the Share**:
   - Click **Apply** and **OK** again to confirm the shared folder settings.

The folder is now shared with the domain users who have full control.

### Common Group Policy Tickets

### **Ticket 10: Group Policy Conflict**

Sometimes conflicting Group Policy settings can cause unexpected behavior. These conflicts can arise when multiple GPOs apply conflicting settings to the same users or computers.

**Resolution Steps**:

1. Open **Group Policy Management Console** (GPMC).
2. Review the GPOs that are applied to the user or computer.
3. Use **Group Policy Modeling** or **Group Policy Results** to simulate the effects of all applied GPOs and identify conflicts.
4. Adjust the link order or use **GPO enforcement** to ensure that the correct policy takes precedence.

**PowerShell Solution**:

```powershell
Get-GPOReport -All -ReportType HTML -Path "C:\\AllGPOsReport.html"
```

**Best Practices**:

- Avoid overlapping or redundant GPOs by grouping related settings into single GPOs when possible.
- Regularly audit your GPOs to ensure they are still necessary and do not conflict.
