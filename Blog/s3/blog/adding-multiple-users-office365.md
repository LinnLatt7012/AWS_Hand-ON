As I dive deeper into Office 365 skills, I recently learned how to manage users and licenses using the Office 365 Admin Center. In this post, I'll walk through how to add multiple users at once, which is an essential skill for IT administrators.

## Key Takeaways from the Lab

By the end of this session, I was able to:

> **Note:** The steps in this lab can change frequently due to updates in Office 365. Always refer to the most up-to-date resources from Microsoft Learning to stay current.
